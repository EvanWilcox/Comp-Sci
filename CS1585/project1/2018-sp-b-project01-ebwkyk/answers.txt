2. git rebase

  a) The graph is linear instead of a fork.

  b) New commits have been made for the old commits.

  c) You can pick and choose what order the commits will be in and also condense multiple commits into one.


3. What does git stash do?

  git stash saves your changes away and reverts back to the original files untill you do git stash apply to bring them back.


4. How can you use git checkout to get the contents of a file from a specific commit?
 
  git checkout commit_hash -- path/to/file

5. 

  git diff                  - See non-staged changes to existing files

  git revert dd61ab21       - revert one commit
  git push origin master    - push it

  git reset --soft HEAD~1   - Undo last commit, preserving local changes

  git reset HEAD file.txt   - Unstage a file

  git clean -f -d           - Delete all untracked files and directories
