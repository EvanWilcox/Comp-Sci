    \item Fully recursive merge sort implemented in Python 2.7.

    \item Define an operation $\dotdiv$ called \textit{bounded subtraction} as follows:

    \begin{enumerate}
      \item $0 \dotdiv a = 0$
      \item $a \dotdiv 0 = a$
      \item $a' \dotdiv b' = a \dotdiv b$
    \end{enumerate}

    Prove that for all a, b in N, $(a+b) \dotdiv b = a$. \\

    Let $Q = \{q \in \mathbb{N} \: | \: (a+q) \dotdiv q = a \}$ \\
    $Q$ is not empty, $0 \in Q$ because $(a+0) \dotdiv 0 = a $

    \item Simulator built in Python 2.7 that was used to test the .fsa files for problems 4 and 5. 
    
    A lines contain an A followed by a space followed by a string containing all the 
    characters in the alphabet. There can only be one A line.

    S lines contain an S followed by a space followed by the name of a state followed 
    by a comma and a space followed by a 0 or 1 if the state is a final state.

    B lines contain a B followed by a space followed by the name of the starting state. 
    There can only be one B line.

    D lines contain a D followed by a space followed by a state followed by a comma and
    a space followed by a character in the alphabet followed by a comma and a space
    followed by the next state.

    T lines contain a T followed by a space followed by the tape to be tested.

    O lines contain an O followed by a space. O lines must come directly after T lines.

    Lines must come in the order described above.

    \item Find a deterministic finite-state automaton that recognizes the language, 
    L, consisting of all strings in \{a, b\}* that contain an odd number of b’s
    such that there is at least one “a” between every two b’s in the string.

    strings having length $\leq$ 6. Construct a deterministic finite-state machine that
    recognizes L.
